      "“There are two ways of making yourself stand out from the crowd. One is by having a job, so big you can go home before the bell rings if you want to. The other is by finding; so much to do that you must stay after the others have gone. The one who enjoys the former once took advantage of the latter”                                        - Henry Ford",
      "One can do all kinds of things to get noticed, but very few of us make a lasting impression. But what if you get noticed in a crowded place of professionals as a real entrepreneur, the leader that you are? Well, there are some strategies that really work.",
      "Most entrepreneurs have a strong and unreflective urge or desire to act, and they are the most passionate people who live by the feelings. But those who understand and practice the art of discipline can channel those urges or desires into something of substance.",
      "Whether you’re in a face-to-face meeting or are communicating via email or letter, it’s essential you come across as original, to ensure you stand out from the crowd. Originality works magically be it your CV or job interview.",
      "To know yourself is an important element for an entrepreneur. Ask others about yourself and get to know your strength and weaknesses. Record your presentations and listen to them. After all, you yourself are your biggest critic.",
      "Always being on time, honoring your commitments and being prepared is the most important thing. Nothing is more powerful than an individual acting out of a well-developed consciousness.",
      "Be good at what you do, know who you are, have passion and communicate all this through a carefully balanced blend of physicality, personality, presence and inner confidence.",
      "It is seen, those people who are competent and capable can attract people who are looking to connect with someone.",
      "An entrepreneur needs to be the kind of person who responds and remembers to follow through on time. Most people neglect and do not follow up on time. Respond to emails, calls, requests, and inquiries at the earliest you can and that makes out a person who respects others and is accountable.",
      "When you truly envisage what you believe, you should not be afraid of obstacles. This confidence will automatically make you stand out from the rest.",
